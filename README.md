> **Figure 2**: The methodology used in this work. First, the agents are trained in a fixed environment. Then an evaluation procedure is performed on the transferred agent to a slightly changed environment. Please note, that from the perspective of the agent the space and observation domain are the same â€” only the underlying dynamics of the environment are different. Finally, the obtained results (in terms of total reward) are used to calculate generalization metrics.

This repository contains code for the research article.

## Running the project container
The all dependencies of this project are packed into a single [Docker Container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/).

TL;DR for your convenience: to run this project, you only need to install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) on your machine. The project have been developed and tested on `Ubuntu 22.04` and `Arch Linux`.

After obtaining working `Docker Engine` & `Docker Compose`:

1. Create the project workspace directory (i.e. `/home/$USER/drl_ws` or just clone this repoistory). Move all code files to that directory. 
2. In the project folder, enter the `docker` subdirectory.
3. Edit the bind-mount paths in `docker-compose.yaml` file (i.e. change `/home/macal/paper_ws` to your's project path). You need to specify the workspace directory, `zshrc` and `zsh_history` files.
4. Inside the `docker` subdirectory, build and run the container:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
5. The entrypoint of the project will start a local Jupyter Lab instance. Please click on the link inside the terminal to proeced further.

## Figures
The published version of our article contains only raster images. To adress that inconvenience we provide the orignal vector files in the `figures` subfolder.

Please note, that the figure 3 is taken from [dm_control: Software and tasks for continuous control](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpa.2020.100022).
